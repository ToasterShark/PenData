Vector Math Boys:
    go from stream of coords to a vector
    like in krita
    -pros:
        very high resolution image, really good comparisons
    -cons:
        have no clue how to do this atm
Lower Resolution:
    Remove "excess" coordinates in a stroke to match the number of coords of the smaller stroke
    -pros:
        easy to write
        yeet yeet
    -cons:
        lose stroke quality
Simplify Strokes into Lines (Duncan Method):
    find the angle between coord 1 and coord 2
    find the angle between coord 2 and coord 3
    find the difference between coord (1-2) and coord (2-3)
    if the angle difference is less than a specific value (k), just connect coord (1-3)
    if the angle difference is greater than k, make a line for (1-2) and (2-3)
    in the future, if (1-3) is one line, instead of finding the angle between 1 & 2, and 2 & 3 - do 1 & 3, 3 & 4
    
    -pros:
        not too hard to write
        can get a very simple character which is easy to compare
        basically say f u to stroke count - just go through based on the lines, not based on the stroke
    -cons:
        okay for linear-focused letters, like a z - but not for o
        the curves are gonna be hard kfjwoefjwofjw
        
Simplify Strokes into Lines (James Method):
    p much the same as the DUncan Method
    difference is:
    -----------------------
    find the angle between 1 & 2
    find the angle between 1 & 3
    find the difference between the two angles
    when the angle is lower than k, just connect them
    when the angle is greater:
        lets say that 1-9 and 1-10 is less than k, but 1-10 and 1-11 is not
        change your starting coord (previously 1) to 10, and begin taking angles 10-11 and 10-?
